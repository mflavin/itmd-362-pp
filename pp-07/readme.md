# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/layout/ 
                          Provide ample spacing for interactive elements. Try to maintain a minimum tappable area of 44pt x 44pt for all controls. 

* How you implemented it in your sketch: Make login button and text boxes easily clickable.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742486.aspx
                          Alignment. The UI elements have coordinated placement, so they are easy to scan and appear orderly.
                          
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Align text boxes, labels, and buttons

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-controls/buttons/
                            Show a hint in a text field to help communicate purpose. A text field can contain placeholder text—such as "Email" or "Password"—when 
                            there’s no other text in the field. Don’t use a separate label to describe a text field when placeholder text is sufficient.
                            
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Keep labels/placeholders short and vauge. Leave them as a hint, so lower opacity so they are not main focus.
