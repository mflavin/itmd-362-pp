## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53w0s0ksKkukurWp+p6yrg5JHaJ
Your Rationale: These colors may work well for a new gaming console because they can give off a relaxing look.
                People may see it and associate it with relaxation, so they will want to use it to just chill out.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32B0s0kl0oZb9CggytBoMl7tIg7
Your Rationale: These colors seem like springtime becuase there is green for representing plants and new grass.
                The orange can also be used to represent plant or sometimes Chicago is seen in orange. Finally, 
                the purple is like music, which would show off the tours.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=34A0s0kleqtbzEKgVuIpcmGtdhZ
Your Rationale: This looks like it works well becuase it has a calm purple color that would be easy on the eyes.
                There is also a yellow that could complement areas of the app and some green that may look good
                if used for some small things, like tabs or buttons.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=30a0s0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: On this color palette there is a red that looks a bit rusty. When thinking of Ruby on Rails in a visual
                way, rubys are red and if you are mining for rubies, there may be rails to cart them around. I see the 
                shade of red like that. There is a blue that can be thought of as learning, so maybe some words on the
                advertising could be in blue. Same for the green, it could probably be used in writing.
