# Production Problem 10: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on a website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)

## Description

For the desktop version, the change that I would make would be a more consistent notification setting. When you just click notifications setting wheel it shows a list of options and lets you check and uncheck them.
When you got to the View Notification Settings link at the bottom of this view, it leads you to a new enviornment and it does not resemble the previous view. It makes it feel as if there are multiple notification 
centers instead of one large page for notifications. The change that I would make would be adding a section with the same options on the larger notification page in the HTML. 

On the moblie version there are two things I would change. First would be when under one of the tabs, such as grades, there is not a home button. I would simply add one in the HTML so users could get back to the 
home page when they need to. Secondly, when under one of the classes and you pull out the navigation bar on the left, all the text on the right gets smashed and pushed down. I would change this so that if the navigation 
would slide out over the text and the text would not be smashed. I would change the CSS so that this could happen.
